After comparisions between groupByKey() and reduceByKey() computaions
The time taken by groupByKey method is - 0.21964 seconds
The time taken by reduceByKey method is - 0.03999 seconds

Hence we can infer that reduceByKey computations are much faster on large data sets when compared to groupByKey

The time taken in reduceByKey is less and it is more efficient because, reduceByKey does a map side combining 
criteria by which the same reducing operations are performed before-hand at map side, which helps in grouping and and
shuffling faster in order to decrease the reducing operations at Reducer side.
         But groupByKey does not perform any reducer or combining operations at map side which leads to increase in
amount of operations at Reducer. Hence time taken in groupByKey is more compared to reduceByKey
